# rdd-4-gt2
Contains files for RDD (Roblox Deployment Downloader) to work on GT2 (GameTest 2). Requires PHP for the proxy to work.

# Why it needs a proxy?
I will give a simple answer: CORS. By using proxy, we technically "bypass" them and get a successful download.

# Setup
Download [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

Clone this repository: `https://github.com/yakovexplorer/rdd-4-gt2.git`

Then, after you installed xampp, extract "src" folder contents to "htdocs" folder (located in C:\xampp)

Go to localhost, and you should see a RDD interface.

Enjoy!
